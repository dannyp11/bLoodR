# Thicker than Blood
by # Dat Pham

Motivation & Need:

Over the past few decades, humans have improved the medical filed vastly. Modern technology allows us to do things that were considered impossible in the past. 
For example, we could clone an entire animal only from a single cell. Or doctors could transplant the heart, liver, and even lungs. 
Even brain restoration is now deemed possible within a decade. With the recently successful bionic limbs that understand and follow the brain’s order, 
one may believe that we could create anything to fix or replace the human body. 
I don’t think so. Although we could make these many awesome bio-medical breakthroughs, we still could not be able to synthesize artificial blood. 
This is because blood is made up from specialized human cells such as white, red cells, plasma, and platelets [2]. These different cell types serve various purposes in the human body. 
For example, red cells carry oxygen and carbon dioxides throughout the body while white cells serve as immunity cells [2] [3]. 
Modern science could create artificial blood from organic materials. However, the artificial blood could only serve one single purpose [2]. 
Nowadays, no safe artificial blood is believed to be a replacement for real blood. As a result, blood donation still serves as one of the most important part of human population wellbeing.
Therefore, a mobile app that helps the community to get access to blood donation bank and events could make a huge impact. 

My Android app will be that app. With around 36000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the U.S. alone not to mention 10000 units of plasma,
timely access to the blood source is critical to both the patients and blood donors [1]. 
My app will let the donors find nearby blood donation events using his/ her location and let the donor enter his or her blood information to the database. 
Blood donor could also enter his/ her blood information to the database so that if there’s a nearby emergency case he/she could be reached. 
Potential donors that match the request could be contacted by the hospital or medical centers.
